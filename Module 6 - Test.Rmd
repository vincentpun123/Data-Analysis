(Problem 1) 
Assume a random sample of size n is from a normal population. 
Assume a single sample t test is used to for hypothesis testing.  
The null hypothesis is that the population mean is zero versus the alternative hypothesis that it is not zero. (TWO TAILED) 

If the sample size is decreased, and (results in smaller t)
the Type I error rate is unchanged, (a stays the same)
then the Type II error rate will increase.

TRUE OR FALSE? (TRUE) 
```{r Problem 1 (ch 9)}
#9.6
"increasing sample size decreaes value of the standard error and the critical value changes"
"increasing sample size decreases B"
#so DECREASE sample size will INCREASE type ii (b)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

(2) 
Assume the population has a normal distribution and 
the number of observations in a random sample is greater than fifty.   

If a z test is used to test a null hypothesis about the population mean versus the 

alternative that the true mean is greater than that specified by the null hypothesis, what is the critical value for a one-tailed test?  

Assume the type one-error rate is 0.05.

#ANSWER IS 1.645 

```


(3) Use the degree of confidence and sample data to construct a confidence interval for the population proportion p.

n = 62, x = 32; 95% confidence  (Use the procedure in Business Statistics Section 8.3.)

0.392 < p < 0.641 (ANSWER)

0.408 < p < 0.669

0.425 < p < 0.647

0.426 < p < 0.646
```{r Problem 3 (CH  8.3)}
n <- 62
a <- 0.95
z <- 1.645
za2 <- 1.96
sampleproportion <- 32/62
pq <- sampleproportion * (1-sampleproportion)

paste("left side",sampleproportion - (za2*((pq/n)**0.5)))

paste("right side",sampleproportion + (za2*((pq/n)**0.5)))

```

(4) Use the given data to find the sample size required to estimate the population proportion.
Margin of error: 0.011; confidence level: 98%; p and q unknown

Which of the following statements is not true?

The sampling distribution of a statistic = the probability distribution for that statistic 
based on all possible random samples from a population.

A symmetric, heavy-tailed distribution cannot be detected using a boxplot and QQ chart.

The t-statistic distribution is based upon the assumption of a random sample from a normal population.

If the sample size is increased and the same test statistic and alpha level are used, 
the power of the test will increase.
```{r Problem 5 (Chegg)}
"Box plot and QQ chart both can be used to find whether distribution is normally distributed or not.

QQ chart are used to determine whether the data match with a normally distributed dataset.

Correct option is b."
```

(6) Use the information to find the minimum sample size required to estimate an unknown population mean µ.  Margin of error: $110, confidence level: 95%, σ = $500.

```{r Problem 6 (Ch. 8.5)}
n <- (1.960*500/110)**2

```

(7) Use the information provided to determine a 95%  confidence interval for the population variance. 

A researcher was interested in the VARIABILITY in service time (in hours) (CHI TEST)
spent by mechanics fixing the same automotive problem.  

A random sample was taken resulting in a sample of size 20 from a substantial file of reported experience.  
The summary statistics are as follows:  

n = 20, 
sample mean = 13.8 hours, 
sample standard deviation = 3.9 hours.  

Assume service time follows a normal distribution.  
Round to two decimal places.

 Solve the problem.

A 99% confidence interval (in inches) for the mean height of a population is 65.7 < µ < 67.3. 
This result is based on a 
sample of size 144. 
Construct the 95% confidence interval. 
(Hint: you will first need to find the sample mean and sample standard deviation).

```{r Problem 8 (Ch. 8.1)}
"65.9 in < µ < 67.1 in."

"Point estimate plus or minus margin of error = upper and lower bound"

x <- (65.7+67.3)/2 #average (mew) (mean)

E <- (67.3-65.7)/2 #margin of error. we need to make this equal to the formula 

z99 <- 2.575

n <- 144

s <- 0.8*(n**0.5)/2.575 #solve for 0.80 (margin of error) equls the formula .. solve for sample sd sigma

z95 <- 1.96 

marginoferror95 <- 1.96 * s / (n**0.5)

Which of the following statements is NOT true for sampling distributions?

Group of answer choices:

A sampling distribution is necessary for making confidence statements about an unknown population parameter.

A sampling distribution depends on the nature of the population being sampled.

When sampling at random from a normal population, the sampling distribution for the sample average is a normal distribution.

None of the above.
```{r Problem 9}
"ANSWER IS NONE OF THE ABOVE" 
```

 Assume normality and use the information given to find the p-value. 
 Based on the p-value estimated, determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected at a 
 0.1 significance level.  (a/2... so 0.05?)
 
 Select the correct answer if the test statistic in a two-tailed test is z= -1.63.  
 Note: Remember that it is a 2-sided test.
 
 p-value = 0.9484; fail to reject the null hypothesis (answer)

p-value = 0.0516; reject the null hypothesis

p-value = 0.1031; fail to reject the null hypothesis

p-value = 0.0258; reject the null hypothesis
```{r Problem 10 (Ch. 9.2)}
#z = -1.63...so z table ... 0.0516
"p-value = 0.1031; fail to reject the null hypothesis"
".0515 * 2 = .1031"
"some  staticians double p value for t wo sided test intead and compare to a"
"so bsically what i shouldve noticed was that option b is correct p value but need to not reject"
"so then next case is to see that 2p is fialed to reject"

"You'll only need t o double the p-value if the significance level given is for one tail and you want to do two tailed tests. The reason is that p-value is by definition the probability of getting a statistic greater than the one reported. As a result, p-value is a one-tailed statistic."


"PROFESSOR SRINIVASAN RESPONSE: 

10)  (3 pts) Assume normality and use the information given to find the p-value.  
Based on the p-value estimated, determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected at a 

0.1 significance level.  

Select the correct answer if the test statistic in a two-tailed test is z= -1.63.  
Note: Remember that it is a 2-sided test.

Using the normal distribution table in Business Statistics the p-value is 0.1032 = 2*0.0516, where 0.0516 equals the tail area left of -1.63.  Refer to Section 9.2 Business Statistics.  Compare this tail area to 0.1 significance level.  

Since the computed table value 0.1032 > 0.1, don’t reject the Null Hypothesis. "
